# Snake Game

This is a classic Snake game developed using Python's turtle module. The player controls the snake to eat food, and with each food item consumed, the snake grows longer. The game ends if the snake hits the wall or itself.

## How to Play

- **Control the snake:** Use the `Up`, `Down`, `Right`, and `Left` arrow keys to move the snake in the respective directions.
- **Objective:** Eat the food that appears randomly on the screen to grow the snake and increase your score.
- **Game Over:** The game ends if the snake hits the wall or its own body.
